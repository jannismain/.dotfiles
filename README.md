# `.dotfiles`

These `.dotfiles` are mostly concerned with zsh configuration right now.

I'm using [zsh4humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans) as a base setup and add my own customizations on top.

## Getting Started

```console
git clone https://github.com/jannismain/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
```
